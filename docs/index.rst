Welcome

Welcome to PySoundCloud. This is a project I made in a week because `soundcloud-python <https://github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-python>`_ no longer works and
hasn't been updated since 2015. Also, SoundCloud has stopped providing API keys.

According to the `SoundCloud API key form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNxc82RJuzC0DnISat7n4H-G7IsPQIdaMpe202iiHZEoso9w/viewform>`_:

..  pull-quote::
    Due to the high amount of requests recently received, we will no longer be processing API application requests at this time. We are working to re-evaluate our process to make it more efficient.

PySoundCloud uses the SoundCloud API V2 and allows you to easily obtain a key from your browser.
To obtain your key, :ref:`read this part of the documentation <client_id>`.
